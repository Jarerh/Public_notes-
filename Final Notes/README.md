### Cloud Concepts Overview 
   - moving to the cloud come with many benafits but alos risks 
     - One of the main themes of moving to the cloud is it is more accessible and easiler to run 
     - it is very cost efficiant, you pay as you go so if 1 day you only need 1tb of space that's what you'll pay and if another you need only 5 gb you will only pay for thoes 5 gb
     - you don't have a certain set limit of resources you have access to 
     - the cloud is easily availalilty and you have access to the cloud 22 hours out of a 24 hour day
     - There are security riscks when moving to the cloud 
     - servers with private information can be pron to cyber attacks
     - There are 3 delivery models of cloud computing 
       - **SAAS(Software as a service)**
           - it is an on demand service 
           - it only runs one instance per user 
           - cost efficent  
           - you can access it throought web browser 
           - end custumers mostly use SAAS
        - **Ex of SAAS:**
            - google docs 
            - gmail
            - micorsoft 360
        - **PAAS(Platform as a Service)**
            - paas is a programming languange used to run differnt types of programms 
            - manage data and application resorces 
            - dev use this 
        - **Ex of PAAS** 
            - AWS 
            - google app angine 
            - elatis bean stock 
        - **IAAS(Infrastructure as a Service)** 
            - allows multiple users to acces computing resources suck as data, storage, virtulization, servers & Networking
            - sis admins use IAAS
        - **Ex of IAAS** 
            - AWS 
            - icloud
            - Microsoft azure 
            - google cloud
            - IBMSmartCloud
   
ll### Cloud Economics, Billing & Support 
   - When accessing most cloud based services such as AWS & IBMSmartCloud you pay as you go and for what you only use
   - In AWS if you reserve a certain amount of digital space AWS will give discounts 
     - **S3** 
         - 50 TB 
           - 0.023 GB/month 
         - 51-100 TB 
           - 0.022 GB/month
         - 500 TB 
            - 0.021 GB/month 
   - AWS also haas a free tier 
     - there are limits to what you can do in the free tier but it is just for beginers to get there feet wet
   - Some AWS free services 
     -750 hours of Amazon EC2 linux or RHEL or SLES t2.micro 
     - 5 gb of Amzon S3
     - vpc( Virtual Privae Cloud) 
     - Auto-scaling 
     - Elastic Beanstalk 
   - An IT infrastructure is an old way of computing where they have on premissis servers 
   - cloud computing is more networking and the servers are off base 
   - you can also calculate the amount of money you may spend on AWS 
   - if you have a budget AWS has a service that will notify you when you are exceading you limit or close to it and you can set auto actions 
     - if you pass your limit you can set an action where it shuts down the service so you wont pass your limit 
   
### Cloud Security 
   - When using cloud services you will need to have cyber scurity 
     - if you have a poor cybersecurity it can be valnirable to attacks and people can have access to private information
   - Some ways hackers can attack you is by malicious code and vulnerablilties with in you fire walls 
   - it also good to have a well structed passwoord for account that have admin access to your sevices 
   - AWS provides services that provide security to your accounts 
   
### Networking & Content Delivery 
   - Networking is what helps you access things online and many diffrent things
   - you can host instances and subnets 
   - what is amazon VPC 
     - it allows you to have a private sectore on the internet where you can uplaod images, vedios, and host websites
     - you can also allow your vpc to be private or public 

### Compute 
   - AWS provides differnt types of comuting 
   - you have access to differnt types of services 
     - Virtual macchine 
     - containers 
     - Serverless 
     - Platform as a Service
   
### Storage 
   - AWS provides differrnt types of storage options
     - EX of AWS storage services 
       - EC2 
       - elastic bean stock 
       - S3 bucket
    - you can also reseve a certain amount of space so you can get a discount or pay as you go
   
### Databases 
   - Databases hold information 
   - dataes hold information for businesses and you can access them through a query SQL 
   - you can access information instantly and very fast 
   - SQL has diffent types of comands so you can specify any information you are tring to find
   
### Cloud Architecture 
   - a well cloud architecutre is very reliable 
   - When busineeses are converting to the cloud they mignt not be getting the fullest use of the cloud architecture 
   - you can hire people to check and tighten some lose ends and where yuo can improve
   - some things that can go wrong with cloud architecture is you may have an active service that isn't being used and that'll be wasted money 
   - A well stuckterd cloud architecture is reliabel and very benificial when done correctly 

### Automatic Scaling & Monitoring 
   - When using AWS you pay for what you use 
   - sometimes you have a budget to only use a certain amount of services 
   - you may over use some services and that wouldn't be goood
   - AWS provides services to prevent that 
   - you can set limits and when thoes limits are met or near the service will automaticly stop its use
